In your pair, create a markdown file answering the following:
Identify 3 scenarios in your everyday life where you use probability.
Using the formula you learned to calculate probabilities, approximate the probabilities of the events in each of those 3 scenarios.
Think about what potential dependencies the events in each of your 3 scenarios have. Calculate the joint probabilities for the events and their dependencies.
Calculate the conditional probabilities for the events given their dependencies.
